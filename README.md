In this repository I will post my progress for the Holbertoon School's "Shell, basics" project.

The goal of this project is to learn: what is the shell, how to navigate inside the shell, search inside the shell, manipulate files inside the shell, work with commands, read man pages and keyboard shortcuts for bash.

If you are a person who has extensive knowledge of the shell maybe this seems to you something very basic, since I am learning, please let me know where I am wrong, what things I can improve or recommend me some web/book to document me more on the subject.

Thanks for taking the time to review it.
